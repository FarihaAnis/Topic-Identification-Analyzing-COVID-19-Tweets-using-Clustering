# Topic Identification: Analyzing Covid-19 Tweets using Clustering Method
</div>

**Skills:**

---
**Situation:** </br>
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an abundance of textual data has emerged on social media, reflecting public sentiments and discussions about the crisis. This project focused on utilizing various clustering algorithms, including K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze a corpus of COVID-19-related tweets to extract valuable insights about prevalent public sentiments and topics.

**Task:** </br>
I was tasked with designing the experimental approach for the K-Means clustering technique, including choosing the right parameters and vectorization methods. My responsibilities also involved analyzing the resulting clusters, summarizing the key findings, and discussing the characteristics, patterns, and implications of the identified clusters. Additionally, I developed visualizations to support and illustrate the analysis, ensuring that the discussion was clear and insightful.
